# About go-xkratos
`go-xkratos` is a tool based on [go-kratos](https://github.com/go-kratos/kratos), with go-xkratos ,we can easier create a micro-service project.

Kratos is a perfect framework,because of my poor golang programing skill ,i can not create a project that `business` and `framework` are separated easily .`Some framework code are in business directory` and `many micro-service projects have a lot of same code` made me create this project.
